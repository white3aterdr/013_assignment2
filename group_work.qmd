## 1. Who collected the data?
The data from @insideairbnb website were collected by the Inside Airbnb project, with contributions from a variety of collaborators and partners.

The raw data were compiled from the @Airbnb website, which was collected by the company Airbnb, Inc.

## 2. Why did they collect it?

On the @insideairbnb website, they write:
>"We work towards a vision where communities are empowered with data and information to understand, decide and control the role of renting residential homes to tourists".

As for the company Airbnb, three considerations may ariseï¼š
  
- Operational aspect: The primary goal is to assist users in making informed decisions-  

- Company aspect: Data collection plays a crucial role in analyzing Airbnb's operational performance across various cities. With the gathered data, Airbnb can fine-tune its operational strategies.

- Legal aspect: In compliance with diverse regulatory requirements, Airbnb must furnish information to the respective authorities as necessary.

## 3. How was the data collected?  

Insideairbnb collected data, which was a snapshot at a particular time, from Airbnb platform.

The data collected by Airbnb can be classified along two dimensions: the data source and the method of generation. 

| |  Objective data  |  Generated during the operation of the platform  |  Subjective data  |
| - | - | - | - |
|  **From host**  | Property data: latitude, longitude, property_type, room_type, etc. Host data: host_name, host_location, host_neighbourhood, etc. These data were provided by hosts but can be verified through photos or qualifications. And some data can also be automatically obtained based on user-provided GPS location. | Host_acceptance_rate, host_response_rate, host_is_superhost, etc. These data were generated by the platform during its operation, but its content depends on the behavior of the host. | Description, neighborhood_overview, host_about, etc. These data were provided by the host and were very subjective description, and its content and tendency depend on the host's own preferences. |
|  **From guest**  | When guest register an Airbnb account, they need to provide personal information such as name, contact details, payment information, etc. | Number_of_reviews, first_review, last_review, etc. These data were generated by the platform, but its content depends on the behavior of the guest. | Review_scores_accuracy, review_scores_cleanliness, comments, etc. These data were provided by the guest, depends on guest preference. |
|  **From platform**  | NA | Host_id, host_url, reviewer_id, etc. These data were automatically generated by Airbnb and the user's behavior has no impact on it. | NA |


## 4. How does the method of collection impact the completeness and/or accuracy of its representation of the process it seeks to study, and what wider issues does this raise?

Completeness: 
- For insideairbnb data, as it is a snapshot of the Airbnb platform at a particular moment, it cannot reflect changing information.
- Regarding the original data on Airbnb, if the collection relies on voluntary submissions (such as reviews from Airbnb hosts and guests), it might not be possible to gather data from all relevant individuals. Self-selection bias could lead to incomplete data, as only certain groups may be willing or able to provide information.

Accuracy: 
- Subjective data provided by users are more prone to issues. For instance, a host's description might have shortcomings due to varying levels of proficiency, and guest reviews could be influenced by personal biases.
- Data generated by the platform might be more accurate but can also be subject to technical errors.
- Objective data, such as geographical location, are usually more accurate and reliable.
