	abstract = {This paper tracks changes in relative centralisation and relative concentration of poverty for the 25 largest British cities, analysing change for poor and non-poor groups separately, and examining parallel changes in spatial segregation. The paper confirms that poverty is suburbanising, at least in the larger cities, although poverty remains over-represented in inner locations. Suburbanisation is occurring through both the reduction in low income populations in inner locations and the growth non-poor groups in these places, consistent with a process of displacement. Relative centralisation of poverty has fallen more stronglythan relative concentration of poverty, as the outward shift of poorer groups leaves them still living in denser neighbourhoods on average. The paper also shows that spatial segregation (unevenness) declined at the same time although it remains to be seen whether this indicates a long-term shift to less segregated urban forms or a transitional outcome before new forms of segregation emerge around suburban poverty concentrations.},

Design/methodology/approach To address the research aims, this study conducted a systematic literature review and content analysis of all relevant articles. Following the review, the methodological sections of the selected papers were examined to identify the characteristics and limitations of all data sources used in the papers. Findings This study revealed several limitations of the use of three major data sources, namely, web scraping with self-made bots, inside Airbnb and AirDNA, for sharing economy research. The review shows that the majority of the selected papers did not acknowledge any limitations, nor did they discuss the quality of the data sources. Research limitations/implications The findings of this paper can serve as guidelines for selecting appropriate data sources for research into the sharing economy and cautions researchers to address the limitations of the data sources used. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that explores the advantages and limitations of data sources used in short-term rental market research.},

	abstract = {Several recently published papers in Decision Support Systems discussed issues related to data quality in Information Systems research. In this short research note, I build on the work introduced in these papers and document two data quality issues discovered in a large open dataset commonly used in research. Inside Airbnb (IA) collects data from places and reviews as posted by users of Airbnb.com. Visitors can effortlessly download data collected by IA for several locations around the globe. While the dataset is widely used in academic research, no thorough investigation of the dataset and its validity has been conducted. This note examines the dataset and explains an issue of incorrect data added to the dataset. Findings suggest that this issue can be attributed to systemic errors in the data collection process. The results suggest that the use of unverified open datasets can be problematic, although the discoveries presented in this work may not be significant enough to challenge all published research that used the IA dataset. Additionally, findings indicate that the incorrect data happens because of a new feature implemented by Airbnb. Thus, unless changes are made, it is likely that the consequences of this issue will only become more severe. Finally, this note explores why reproducibility is a problem when two different releases of the dataset are compared.},

More precisely, we believe that rent gap theory is helpful to advance our understanding of why and how professionalized hosting has become an increasingly salient phenomenon and for centering the active role of Airbnb as a platform operator. We develop the notion of platform-scale rent gaps to explain the economic logic that drives Airbnb to professionalize its hosts and gentrify its platform. We then discuss Airbnb’s professionalization programs and tools, showing how some of its most substantial resources primarily cater to large-scale property managers who, like Airbnb itself, seek to identify and close rent gaps on the platform. This consequently creates the conditions for uneven business development opportunities among hosts, which we illustrate by focusing on how two different types of hosts have sought to professionalize their business in Berlin. Finally, we conclude by speculating on the relationship between the gentrification of the Airbnb platform and urban gentrification.},

	abstract = {Hedonic modelling techniques have frequently been used to examine real estate valuation, and they have recently started to be applied to short-term rental valuation. Relying on a web-scraped data set of all Airbnb transactions in New York City (NYC) between August 2014 and September 2016, this paper presents the first hedonic regression model of Airbnb to take into account neighbourhood effects and to predict both average price per night and revenue generated by each listing. The model demonstrates that locational factors – above all, transit accessibility to jobs – and neighbourhood variation have a large impact on both price per night and monthly revenue, and further reveals how professionalization of the short-term rental market is driving more revenue to a narrower segment of hosts. Further, the findings suggest that Airbnb hosts earn a significant premium by converting long-term housing in accessible residential neighbourhoods into de facto Airbnb hotels. This premium incentivizes landlords and hosts with properties in accessible neighbourhoods to replace long-term tenants with short-term guests, forcing those in search of housing to less accessible neighbourhoods.},

	abstract = {The rise of online platforms has disrupted numerous traditional industries. A prime example is the short-term accommodation platform Airbnb and how it affects the hotel industry. On the one hand, consumers can profit from Airbnb due to an increased number of choices and lower prices. On the other hand, critics of the platform argue that it allows professional hosts to operate de facto hotels while being subject to much laxer regulation. Understanding the nature of competition between Airbnb and hotels as well as quantifying consumer welfare gains from Airbnb is important to inform the debate on necessary platform regulation. In this paper, we analyze competition between hotels and Airbnb listings as well as the effect of Airbnb on consumer welfare. For this purpose, we use granular daily-level data from Paris for the year 2017. We estimate a nested logit model of demand that allows for consumer segmentation along accommodation types and the different districts within the city. We extend prior research by accounting for the localized nature of competition within districts of the city. Our results suggest that demand is segmented by district as well as accommodation type. Based on the parameter estimates, we calibrate a supply-side model to assess how Airbnb affects hotel revenues and consumer welfare. Our simulations imply that Airbnb increases average consumer surplus by 4.3 million euro per night and reduces average hotel revenues by 1.8 million euro. Furthermore, we find that 28 percent of Airbnb travelers would choose hotels if Airbnb did not exist.},
